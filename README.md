# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Style Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS.  The problem involves styles not being applied correctly due to an issue with the `content` option in the Tailwind configuration file.  The bug is particularly tricky because it is highly dependent on the project's directory structure and file naming conventions.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as unexpected behavior where certain components do not apply Tailwind CSS styles.  This happens despite seemingly correct class names and configurations. The root cause lies in how Tailwind resolves paths in the `content` option.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application (method depends on your setup, e.g., using a dev server). 
4. Observe that certain parts of the application lack the expected styles, despite using valid Tailwind classes. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing and adjusting the `content` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file to correctly point to the source files where Tailwind CSS classes are used.

## Additional Notes

This is a non-trivial bug. It highlights the importance of carefully inspecting Tailwind's `content` configuration when encountering unexpected styling problems, particularly those involving specific project structures.
